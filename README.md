# Adventure Works

A simple front end built in React for browsing and updating records via an OData API with the Adventure Works database.

Adventure Works is a sample database provided by Microsoft to demonstrate how to design a database in SQL Server. It is old by todays standards but I wanted to use something that is simple and publicly available. You can find more information here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms. Please note I am using the lightweight version.

This is meant to serve as a portfolio/demo to show off my background and passion for front-end development. It is an active work in progress that I contribute to almost daily. It currently uses React Bootstrap (Bootstrap 5), React Router, and Redux. I plan to add much more in the coming days/weeks/months.
